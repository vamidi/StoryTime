  phrases:
  - key: EX_ACID
    value: The Acid Prefab uses a Box Collider set to 'Trigger' to check when Ellen
      has fallen into it. The DeathVolume component will then force Ellen to respawn
      at her latest checkpoint
  - key: EX_PAD
    value: 'This pressure pad uses the ''Send on Trigger Enter'' component to open
      the door when Ellen enters the pad''s box collider. Once the pad is triggered,
      it uses the GameCommandReceiver to tell the door''s SimpleTranslator component
      to activate. '
  - key: EX_SWTCH
    value: This single switch is another example of 'Send on Trigger Enter' being
      used to open a door. The connection between the switch and the door is shown
      in the Scene View.
  - key: EX_SWTCHS
    value: Multiple switches are used with the Gameplay Counter component to activate
      a GameObject in the scene
  - key: EX_BOX
    value: These boxes use the 'OnDeath' event of the Damageable component to spawn
      particles and smaller phsyics-enabled cubes
  - key: EX_MOVPLAT
    value: This moving platform uses the SimpleTranslator component. Start and End
      points are shown as gizmos in the scene view to easily customise the start and
      end positions
  - key: EX_ENEMY
    value: Chomper likes to bite and Spitter will attack from range. You can easily
      make changes to their behaviour using their Chomper and Spitter components!
  - key: PP_SIDE
    value: I'm not heavy enough to press this... Looks like I'll have to use the box
      above!
  - key: SWTCH_HOUSE
    value: It's locked... Maybe one of the boxes will have a key inside...
  - key: BOX_PCKUP
    value: A key! This should come in handy!
  - key: END
    value: The treasure is finally mine!
